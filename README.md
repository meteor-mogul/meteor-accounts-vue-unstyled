# Meteor Mogul meteor-accounts-vue-unstyled

This provides a user interface to the Meteor Accounts system.

Goal is to re-write to use VueJS instead of Blaze.

Forked from [Meteor development code](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/accounts-ui-unstyled)

## Upstream README

A version of `accounts-ui` without the CSS, so that you can add your
own styling. See the [`accounts-ui`
README](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/accounts-ui) and the
Meteor Accounts [project page](https://www.meteor.com/accounts) for
details.
